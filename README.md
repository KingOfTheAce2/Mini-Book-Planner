# Mini Book Planner

A simple React-based tool for planning the structure and content of a short book. It loads React from a CDN so it can run directly in the browser without a build step.

## Running Locally
Open `index.html` in your browser. The application will load and you can begin outlining chapters, subpoints and paragraphs.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages
1. Push the repository to GitHub.
2. Enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings and choose the `main` branch as the source (or a `gh-pages` branch if preferred).
3. The site will be served from `https://<username>.github.io/<repository>/`.

## Features
- Create a mini book outline from preset models.
- Edit titles and content for chapters, subpoints and paragraphs.
- Track word counts against target chapter lengths.
- Import and export outlines as Markdown files.

## Still To Implement
The following improvements are planned but not yet implemented:

1. Dynamic add/remove of subpoints and paragraphs.
2. Support for nesting content deeper than the current chapter → subpoint → paragraph hierarchy.
3. Next/Previous navigation buttons.
4. Search functionality.
5. Drag-and-drop reordering of chapters, subpoints and paragraphs.
6. Export to DOCX in addition to Markdown.
7. Rich text editing (bold, italics, lists, etc.).
8. Table support.
9. Enhanced spell check beyond the browser defaults.
10. Character count and per-section goals.
11. Import from Word or PDF.
12. Dark mode toggle.
13. User-adjustable font sizes.
14. Estimated reading time per section.
